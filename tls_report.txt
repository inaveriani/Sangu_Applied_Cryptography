 Security Implications of This Handshake

Client Hello - Initiates handshake, lists supported cipher suites, includes a random number
Server Hello - Server selects cipher suite, sends its certificate (authenticity)
Certificate - Enables client to verify server's identity via CA
Key Exchange - Securely exchanges pre-master key, forms the basis of symmetric encryption 
Change Cipher Spec - Signals switch from plaintext to encrypted communication
Finished (Encrypted) - Ensures handshake integrity (both client and server prove they know the shared secret)

TLS Protection Against MITM (As Seen Here)
Certificate from Trusted CA:
   Verified by the client to ensure authenticity.
   Prevents MITM from impersonating server unless they have a valid certificate.
Public Key Encryption:
   Ensures key exchange is secure even if MITM observes the handshake.
MAC & Encryption:
   Application data is encrypted and protected from tampering.


HTTPS is simply the HTTP protocol operating over a secure TLS (or SSL) connection. TLS provides the security 
layer underneath the application protocol (HTTP). It ensures:  
   Confidentiality: The encryption negotiated during the handshake (using the derived session keys) 
   prevents eavesdroppers (like someone on the same Wi-Fi network or an ISP) from reading the content 
   of your communication (e.g., login credentials, pages visited, data submitted).  

   Integrity: The message authentication ensures that the data exchanged between your browser and the server 
   has not been tampered with or altered during transit. You can be sure the web page you receive is the one the 
   server sent, and the data you submit arrives unchanged. 

   Authentication: The server certificate verification assures you that you are communicating with the genuine 
   ums.sangu.edu.ge server, not an imposter site set up by an attacker (protecting against MITM and phishing related 
   to fake websites).

In essence, TLS creates a secure, private "tunnel" between your browser and the web server, protecting the HTTP 
traffic flowing within it. When you see https:// and the padlock icon in your browser, it signifies that these TLS 
protections are active for your connection to that site.
