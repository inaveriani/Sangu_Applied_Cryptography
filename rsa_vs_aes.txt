RSA vs. AES:

RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman):
- Asymmetric encryption: Uses a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.
- Slower than AES, especially for large data.
- Primarily used for key exchange and digital signatures.
- Higher key sizes (e.g., 2048 bits) provide stronger security.
- More computationally intensive.

AES (Advanced Encryption Standard):
- Symmetric encryption: Uses the same key for encryption and decryption.
- Much faster than RSA, suitable for encrypting large amounts of data.
- Commonly used for data encryption, file encryption, and network security.
- Key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits.
- Less computationally intensive than RSA.

Use-Case Differences:

- RSA is typically used for securely exchanging symmetric keys (like AES keys) or for digital signatures where verifying the origin of the data is important.
- AES is used for encrypting large amounts of data efficiently, such as files, databases, or network traffic.

Performance Differences:
- AES is significantly faster than RSA for encryption and decryption.
- RSA's performance degrades as the data size increases, whereas AES maintains consistent performance.
- Because RSA is slow, it is not practical for encrypting large data sets.
